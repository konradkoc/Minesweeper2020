# Minesweeper2020
This was my first JS project made all the way from scratch. <br>
I've always been a fan of minesweeper so I decided to code it :)<br>
It's made with vanilla JS & HTML & CSS. First JS file is board.js <br> <br>
There are few things I want to improve in this project in the future: <br>
<li>Rearrange the code to use modules and implement Webpack with Babel to support IE ... </li>
<li>Improve win animation, now it is kinda disappointing...</li>
<li>Add more animations: clicking on the bomb and losing the game, reaveling more than one cell etc </li>
<br>
If you don't know how to play the game (doubt) check out the wikipedia link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game) <br>

<b> Enjoy!!! </b>
